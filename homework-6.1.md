## Homework 6.1: Follow the Arrows!

* Use your upstream remote to pull homework-6.1.md into your workspace on Cloud9 (hint: git pull upstream master).
 
* Find a section in your projects that has some decent looping and branching code: at least five branches that you can diagram.
* Copy-paste your example into homework-6.1.md and attempt to identify the loop conditions with comments e.g. 

```php
while ( $count < $max ) {
// while $count is less than $max

foreach ( $collection as $item ) {
// until there are no more $items in the $collection"
```

* Save your file locally, git add and git commit it (don't forget: -m 'explain why!'), and git push your changes to your Github account.
* **Bonus points:** open a pull request back to the original repo.
