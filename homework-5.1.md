## Homework 5.1: Starting to understand more complex French

* Login to Github and approve my pull request to get the file `homework-5.1.md` in your `assignments` repository.
* Log into Cloud9 and use `git pull` to get the file into your workspace.
 
* Find [the Wordpress project on Github][wordpress], fork it into your own account, and clone it into a Cloud9 workspace.
* Open your Wordpress workspace and find a file that has some branching _if-then-else_ logic; look for some juicy conditionals and guard clauses.
* Copy-paste your examples into `homework-5.1.md` (this file) and attempt to identify the conditions with comments like so:
> USERNAME/Wordpress/path/to/file.php:00
> ```php
>   if ( $mom_says == 'yes' ) // if mom says yes
> ```

* Save your file locally, add and commit it with git, and push your changes to your Github account.
* **Bonus points**: open a pull request back to the original repo with your work to date.
